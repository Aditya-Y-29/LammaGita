the family become corrupt; and , women being corrupted, O Varshenya (descendant
of Vrishni), there arises intermingling of castes.","From this shloka, we can learn that when impiety prevails in society, it leads to the corruption of women. The corruption of women then leads to the intermingling of castes, which disrupts the social fabric. This teaches us the importance of upholding righteousness and morality, as they act as a foundation for maintaining harmony, purity, and stability in society."

slay me in battle, unresisting and unarmed, that would be better for me.","In this verse, Arjuna expresses his inner conflict and is willing to be killed rather than fighting his own kin.

"2.2 The Blessed Lord said  Whence is this perilous strait come upon thee, this dejection which is unworthy of you, disgraceful, and which will close the gates of heaven upon you, O Arjuna?","From this shloka, humans can learn that they should not succumb to dejection and despair, as it is unworthy and can prevent them from attaining true happiness and success.

Sometimes, fighting for what is right may require us to confront and overcome our inner conflicts and face challenging circumstances."
"2.5 Better it is, indeed, in this world to accept alms than to slay the most noble teachers. But if I kill them, even in this world all my enjoyments of wealth and fulfilled desires will be stained with (their) blood.","From this shloka, we can learn that it is far better to humbly accept help from others than to harm or cause suffering to those who have taught us or guided us. By choosing violence, even our worldly achievements and desires will be tarnished with guilt and remorse. Therefore, we should always prioritize non-violence and gratitude towards our teachers and benefactors."

"2.9 Sanjaya said  Having spoken thus to Hrishikesha (the Lord of the senses), Arjuna (the coneror of sleep), the destroyer of foes, said to Krishna, ""I will not fight"" and became silent.","From this verse, we learn that Arjuna, in a moment of despair, was overwhelmed and decided not to fight. His silence represents his confusion and lack of direction. This teaches us the importance of clarity and conviction in our actions. We should not let fear or doubt hinder us from fulfilling our responsibilities. Instead, we must seek guidance and find inner strength to face challenges with determination."
"2.10 To him who was despondent in the midst of the two armies, Krishna, as if smiling, O Bharata, spoke these words.","In the face of life's battles and challenges, when one is filled with doubt and despair, one should seek guidance and wisdom.

None can cause the destruction of That, the Imperishable.","From this verse, we can learn that there is an eternal and indestructible essence that pervades everything. This essence cannot be destroyed by anyone or anything. It teaches us the concept of the eternal soul or the higher self that exists within each individual. Understanding this can help us cultivate a sense of inner stability and strength, knowing that our true essence is everlasting and immortal."
"2.18 These bodies of the embodied Self, Which is eternal, indestructible and immeasurable, are said to have an end. Therefore fight, O Arjuna.","From this shloka, one can learn that the true essence of our being is eternal and indestructible.

"2.19 He who takes the Self to be the slayer and he who thinks It is slain, neither of them ï1knowsï1. It slays not, nor is It slain.","From this shloka, we learn that the true Self is not subject to birth or death. The individual, mistakenly identifying with the body, believes either to be the slayer or the slain. However, the Self itself is beyond such actions and remains untouched. Recognizing this eternal nature of the Self leads to the understanding that it is not the doer or recipient of any action, ultimately leading to liberation from suffering."
"2.20 It is not born, nor does It ever die; after having been, It again ceases not to be; unborn, eternal, changeless and ancient, It is not killed when the body is killed.","From this shloka, we learn that the true essence of a human being, the soul, is eternal and indestructible. It is not born with the body, nor does it die when the body dies. The soul is timeless and unaffected by the cycle of birth and death. Understanding this can bring solace and remind us to focus on the eternal aspects of life instead of being consumed by temporary circumstances."
"2.21 Whosoever knows It to be indestructible, eternal, unborn and inexhaustible, how can that man slay, O Arjuna, or cause to be slain?","From this shloka, we learn that the eternal soul within us is indestructible and cannot be harmed. A wise person understands this truth, realizing that they are not the body but an immortal spirit. Therefore, they do not engage in actions that cause harm to others. This teaches us to treat all life with respect and cultivate a sense of non-violence and compassion."
"2.22 Just as a man casts off worn-out clothes and puts on new ones, so also the embodied Self casts off worn-out bodies and enters others which are new.","From this shloka, one can learn that just as we discard old and worn-out clothes for new ones, the eternal soul discards old and decaying bodies to enter new ones. It implies the concept of rebirth and the continuous cycle of life and death. It teaches us that death is merely a change of condition for the soul and offers comfort in understanding the transient nature of our physical existence."
"2.23 Weapons cut It not, fire burns It not, water wets It not, wind dries It not.","From Bhagvad Gita, we learn about the immortal soul, which can never be destroyed. Just as weapons cannot harm the soul, external elements like fire, water, and wind cannot affect it. The teaching reminds us to recognize our inner divinity, remain steadfast and unaffected by external circumstances, and focus on the eternal essence of our being."
"2.24 This Self cannot be cut, burnt, wetted, nor dried up. It is eternal, all-pervading, stable, immovable and ancient.","From this shloka, a human can learn that their true Self, the soul, is indestructible and eternal. It cannot be harmed by any physical or external forces. The Self is omnipresent, unchanging, and has existed since ancient times. Realizing this eternal nature of the Self can bring stability, strength, and a sense of immovability to face life's challenges with courage and resilience."

"2.26 But even if thou thinkest of It as being constantly born and constantly dying, even then, O mighty-armed, thou shouldst not grieve.","In this verse, Lord Krishna advises us not to be saddened by the transient nature of life.

This teaches us the importance of accepting reality and finding inner strength amidst life's ever-changing nature."
"2.27 For certain is death for the born, and certain is birth for the dead; therefore, over the inevitable thou shouldst not grieve.","One can learn from this shloka that death is certain for the living, and birth is certain for the dead.

"2.28 Beings are unmanifested in their beginning, manifested in their middle state, O Arjuna, and unmanifested again in their end. What is there to grieve about?","This shloka reminds us of the eternal nature of life. Just as beings transition from the unmanifested state to the manifested state and back to the unmanifested state, our existence is also a continuous journey.

"2.29 One sees This (the Self) as a wonder; another speaks of It as a wonder; another hears of It as a wonder; yet having heard, none understands It at all.","This shloka teaches us that the true nature of the self is beyond comprehension. People may perceive it in different ways - some see it as extraordinary, some describe it as extraordinary, and some hear about it as extraordinary.

"2.30 This, the Indweller in the body of everyone, is ever indestructible, O Arjuna; therefore, thou shouldst not grieve for any creature.","From this verse, we learn that the soul, the eternal essence within every living being, is immortal and cannot be destroyed.

This teaching encourages us to understand the transient nature of life and find solace in the eternal aspect of our existence."
"2.31 Further, having regard to thy duty, shouldst not waver, for there is nothing higher for a Kshatriya than a righteous war.","This shloka emphasizes the importance of standing firm in one's duty without hesitation.

True honor lies in staying true to ourselves, irrespective of external opinions."
2.35 The great car-warriors will think that thou hast withdrawn from the battle through fear; and thou wilt be lightly held by them who have thought much of thee.,"One can learn from this verse that sometimes, others may perceive withdrawing from a difficult situation as a sign of fear or weakness.

"2.36 Thy enemies also, cavilling at thy power, will speak many abusive words. What is more painful than this?","This shloka teaches us that in life, we may face criticism and hurtful words from our enemies, which can be extremely painful.

Now listen to wisdom concerning Yoga, endowed with which, O Arjuna, thou shalt cast off the bonds of action.","From the above verse, we can learn that the Bhagvad Gita imparts two kinds of wisdom: Sankhya, the understanding of our true nature, and Yoga, the means to detach from the cycle of actions. By practicing Yoga, we can free ourselves from the bondage of constantly seeking outcomes, and instead focus on performing our duties with utmost dedication, detachment, and equanimity. This leads to self-realization and liberation from the burdens of life."
